Punching Bag is a utility that makes it dead simple to start and configure 
vulnerable machines in the cloud. Use it for penetration testing training.

How to use: 

Install the prerequisite gems with bundler. Do a 'bundle  install' in the root
directory. If you have troubles with this, try 'gem install bundler.'

Copy config/pb_config.yml.sample to config/pb_config.yml and add your Amazon 
keys. These can be found in the AWS Console at http://aws.amazon.com (Browse to 
account -> Security Credentials).

Once you've configure the pb_config.yml file, you can start machines with the 
thor commands. 'thor x:start <machinename>' -- You can find the machine names by
 running 'thor x:list'.
 
$ thor x:list
